 Create a function that calculates base raised to the power of exponent using recursion.
 Do not use any math library functions.
 Handle the base case: any number to the power of 0 equals 1.
 For negative exponents, return 0 (integer division).
 For example: power(2, 3) should return 8

 Here's how it should be prototyped:
 int  power(int base, int exp);

 Test cases:
 power(2, 0) should return 1
 power(3, 4) should return 81
 power(5, 1) should return 5
