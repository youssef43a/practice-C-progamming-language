Exercise 1.2: Fibonacci Sequence
 Turn-in directory: ex02/
 Files to turn in: fibonacci.c
 Allowed functions: printf (for testing only)
 Create a function that returns the nth number in the Fibonacci sequence using recursion.
 The Fibonacci sequence starts with 0 and 1, and each subsequent number is the sum of the two
 preceding ones.
 Sequence: 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34 .
 For example: fibonacci(6) should return 8
Handle edge cases: fibonacci(0) = 0, fibonacci(1) = 1
 
 For negative inputs, return -1

 Here's how it should be prototyped:
 int  fibonacci(int n);

 Test cases:
 fibonacci(0) should return 0
 fibonacci(1) should return 1
 fibonacci(7) should return 13
