 Exercise 1.1: Calculate Factorial

 Create a function that calculates the factorial of a given number using recursion.
 The factorial of n (written as n!) is the product of all positive integers less than or equal to n.
 For example: 5! = 5 × 4 × 3 × 2 × 1 = 120
 Handle the base case: 0! = 1 and 1! = 1
 Your function should handle negative numbers by returning 0.
 Here's how it should be prototyped:

int factorial(int n);
 Test cases:
 factorial(0) should return 1
 factorial(5) should return 120
 factorial(-3) should return 0
